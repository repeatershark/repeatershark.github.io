<p>&nbsp;I lifted her with immense struggle, holding her in my arms. She was so close that I could feel her breath on my neck. Somehow, she still held the almost completely disintegrated sweater above her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; she muttered softly, &ldquo;that while we&rsquo;re probably in an apocalypse, your face is beet-red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; I said sheepishly. &ldquo;Keep holding out for just a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we entered the school, it was eerily silent. What was once bustling and well-populated with students and professors in the early morning was now silent or, ironically described, dead. The walls were partially coated with blood&ndash;splatter prints all around the puddles. Piles of bodies lay motionless in the halls, some still barely breathing, others completely lifeless. The buzzing noise returned, but from a comfortably far distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to find someplace to hide from those&nbsp;things.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Behind us, loud footsteps, accompanied by low moaning, reverberated through the halls. I quickened my pace as the footsteps grew louder and more frequent. &ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; she whispered in my ear, her tone panicked. She pointed to a white postern in between two glass classroom doors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grasped the doorknob and carefully turned it counterclockwise. As the door opened, a loud creak emanated from the hinges. The resounding footsteps stopped instantly. Whatever their source was had heard our entry; with this in mind, I darted into the closet and slowly, though urgently, closed it with a soft click.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To call the room cramped was more than an understatement. From the door to the end of the room, I could estimate it was about six feet long. From the left wall to the right, it might&rsquo;ve been around four feet. And if that wasn&rsquo;t compact enough, bulky equipment was scattered around the floor, and a metal shelf took up a good two feet of the back end. I leaned her against a ladder and flipped the lights on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blood had caked her calf, but luckily, the flow of blood had seemed to slow down. Scanning the shelf, I found a satisfactorily thick towel and laid it over most of the cuts. Then I unbuttoned my dress shirt, leaving only my gray tank top underneath, and wrapped it tightly around her leg. To break the ice, her eyes still closed, she said, &ldquo;Considering our circumstances, a broom closet isn&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t seem quite so good after a few hours here.</p>
<p>I tucked the last bit of shirt into the space between the rest wrapped around her leg. &ldquo;You can open your eyes now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered open. So gracefully, so gently. The thought ran through my head a couple of times before I remembered it wasn&rsquo;t the time to fawn over her. Our lives were likely at stake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A stinging pain shot up my arm and I stumbled back, against the wall in an extremely uncomfortable position as her knees pressed into my side. I grimaced as I cradled the aching arm, noting that the pain, compared to when I had first received the burns, had noticeably intensified to a much higher degree. Without hesitation nor asking permission&ndash;though I didn&rsquo;t especially care&ndash; Ophelia grabbed my arm, her fingers placed carefully in a certain area far enough from the wound so as to not cause me any affliction.&nbsp;</p>
